    "The combined strategy selected offers two key benefits that work together to create more effective chunks for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system:\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintaining Semantic Integrity: By using the MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter first, you ensure that the content is grouped by its logical structure. Instead of simply cutting text at a certain character limit, this method keeps entire sections (like \"Introduction\" or \"Soil Health\") together. This means that a chunk retrieved for a query will likely contain the complete context of a single topic, leading to more accurate and relevant answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing for LLM Context Windows: After the first stage, the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter takes over. It breaks down those larger, logically-sound sections into smaller, more manageable chunks. This is crucial because it ensures that each final chunk is small enough to fit within the limited context window of an LLM. This prevents data loss and allows you to process very long documents without losing the important, higher-level context."

His\\noﬀensive upon the land’s patchwork of small Hindu em-\\npires proved to be highly successful due to the disunity\\nof the petty rulers. It was Chanakya Pandit who, feeling\\ndeeply distressed at heart, searched for and discovered a\\nqualiﬁed leader in the person of Chandragupta Maurya.\\nAlthough a mere dasi-putra, that is, a son of a maidser-\\nvant by the Magadha King Nanda, Chandragupta was\\nhighly intelligent, courageous and physically powerful.\\nChanakya cared little that by birth he should not have\\ndared to approach the throne. A man of acute discre-\\ntion, Chanakya desired only that a ruler of extraordi-\\nnary capabilities be raised to the exalted post of King of', 'dared to approach the throne. A man of acute discre-\\ntion, Chanakya desired only that a ruler of extraordi-\\nnary capabilities be raised to the exalted post of King of\\nMagadha so that the oﬀensive launched by the Yavanas\\n(Greeks) could be repressed.\\nIt is said that Chanakya had been personally of-\\nfended by King Nanda and that this powerful brahmana\\nhad vowed to keep his long sikha unknotted until he\\nsaw to the demise of the contemptuous ruler and his\\ndrunken princes. True to his oath, it was only after\\nChanakya Pandit engineered a swift death for the de-\\ngraded and worthless rulers of the Nanda dynasty that\\nthis great brahmana was able to again tie up his tuft of\\nhair. There are several versions relating the exact way\\nthat Chanakya had set about eliminating the Nandas,\\nand it appears historians have found it diﬃcult to sep-\\narate fact from folk legend as regards to certain speciﬁc\\ndetails.\\nAfter the Nanda downfall, it became easy for Chan-', 'and it appears historians have found it diﬃcult to sep-\\narate fact from folk legend as regards to certain speciﬁc\\ndetails.\\nAfter the Nanda downfall, it became easy for Chan-\\ndragupta to win the support of the Magadha citizens,\\nwho responded warmly to their new heroic and hand-\\nsome young ruler. Kings of neighbouring states rallied\\nunder Chandragupta’s suzerainty and the last of the\\nGreeks headed by Alexander’s general Seleucus were de-\\nfeated.\\nWith the dual obstacles of the Nandas and Alexan-\\nder’s troops out of the way, Chanakya Pandit used every\\npolitical device and intrigue to unite the greater portion\\nof the Indian sub-continent. Under the Prime minis-\\ntership of Chanakya, King Chandragupta Maurya con-\\nquered all the lands up to Iran in the North west and\\ndown to the extremities of Karnataka or Mysore state in\\nthe South. It was by his wits alone that this skinny and\\nill-clad brahmana directed the formation of the great-\\nest Indian empire ever before seen in history (i.e. since', 'the South. It was by his wits alone that this skinny and\\nill-clad brahmana directed the formation of the great-\\nest Indian empire ever before seen in history (i.e. since\\nthe beginning of Kali-yuga). Thus the indigenous Vedic\\nculture of the sacred land of Bharata was protected and\\nthe spiritual practices of the Hindus could go on unham-\\npered.\\nAlthough many great savants of the science of niti\\nsuch as Brihaspati, Shukracharya, Bhartrihari and Vish-\\nnusharma have echoed many of these instructions in\\ntheir own celebrated works, it is perhaps the way that\\nChanakya applied his teachings of niti-shastra that has\\nmade him stand out as a signiﬁcant historical ﬁgure.\\nThe great Pandit teaches us that lofty ideals can become\\na certain reality if we intelligently work towards achiev-\\ning our goal in a determined, progressive and practical\\nmanner.\\nDr. R. Shamashastry, the translator of the English\\nversion of Kautilya’s Artha-Shastra, quotes a predic-', 'ing our goal in a determined, progressive and practical\\nmanner.\\nDr. R. Shamashastry, the translator of the English\\nversion of Kautilya’s Artha-Shastra, quotes a predic-\\ntion from the Vishnu Purana fourth canto, twenty-fourth\\nchapter, regarding the appearance of Chanakya Pandit.\\nThis prediction, incidentally, was scribed ﬁfty centuries\\nago, nearly 2,700 years before this political heavyweight\\nand man of destiny was to appear. The prediction in-\\nforms us: ”(First) Mahapadma then his sons - only nine\\nin number - will be the lords of the earth for a hun-\\ndred years. A brahmana named Kautilya will slay these\\nNandas. On their death, the Mauryas will enjoy the\\nearth. Kautilya himself will install Chandragupta on the\\nthrone. His son will be Bindusara and his son will be\\nAshokavardhana.” Similar prophecies are also repeated\\nin the Bhagavata, Vayu and Matsya Puranas.\\nIn presenting this work I have traced out and re-\\nferred to two old English versions of Chanakya Niti-', 'Ashokavardhana.” Similar prophecies are also repeated\\nin the Bhagavata, Vayu and Matsya Puranas.\\nIn presenting this work I have traced out and re-\\nferred to two old English versions of Chanakya Niti-\\nshastra published at the close of the last century. How-\\never, these apparently were translated by mere schol-\\nars (not devotees) who seem to have missed many sub-\\ntleties of Chanakya’s vast wit and wisdom. Another\\nunedited and unpublished manuscript Chanakya Niti-\\nshastra with both English translation and Latinised translit-\\neration produced by the Vrindavana ISKCON Centre\\nwas also referred to. It was however the learned Vaish-\\nnava pandit and Sanskrit scholar Sri V. Badarayana\\nMurthy, of the South Indian Madhva School, who helped\\nme see the depth and import of these verses from the\\noriginal Devanagari.\\nI have been told that our blessed spiritual master His\\nDivine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada\\nhad expressed a desire that Sri Chanakya Niti-shastra', 'original Devanagari.\\nI have been told that our blessed spiritual master His\\nDivine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada\\nhad expressed a desire that Sri Chanakya Niti-shastra\\nbe properly translated into English. It is hoped that our\\npresent rendering will be at least useful if not instructive\\nto the reader. Let us examine now in a few words on the\\nscience of niti, or common sense, from the pen of Srila\\n1', 'Bhaktivinoda, the great 19th century devotee-pioneer of\\nthe worldwide propagation of Lord Chaitanya ’s divine\\nmessage.\\nTaking the two words ”common sense” right up to\\ntheir highest level, he has written:\\nMan’s glory is in common sense,\\nDictating us the grace,\\nThat man is made to live and love\\nThe beauteous Heaven’s embrace.\\nIn other words, the real goal of niti, indeed the goal\\nof life, is to realise one’s eternal position of Krishna con-\\nsciousness. The Bhagavad-gita conﬁrms Srila Bhaktivin-\\node’s view in the ﬁnal line of its last sloka: dhruva ni-\\ntir matir mama. A translation of that full verse runs:\\n”(Sanjaya said) Wherever there is Krishna the master of\\nall mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna the supreme\\narcher, there will also be opulence, victory, extraordi-\\nnary power and morality (niti). That is My opinion.”\\nMiles Davis (Patita Pavana dasa)\\nMakara Sankranti Day\\nPausa Shukla Navami\\n14th January 1981\\nLucknow, India\\nhttp://www.indiadivine.com/chanakya-niti-shastra.htm', 'Miles Davis (Patita Pavana dasa)\\nMakara Sankranti Day\\nPausa Shukla Navami\\n14th January 1981\\nLucknow, India\\nhttp://www.indiadivine.com/chanakya-niti-shastra.htm\\nChapter One\\n(The Political Ethics of Chanakya Pandit)\\n1.

A stranger asked a brahmana, ”Tell me, who is great\\nin this city?” The brahmana replied, ”The cluster of\\npalmyra trees is great.” Then the traveller asked, ”Who\\nis the most charitable person?” The brahmana answered,\\n”The washerman who takes the clothes in the morning\\nand gives them back in the evening is the most chari-\\ntable.” He then asked, ”Who is the ablest man?” The', '”The washerman who takes the clothes in the morning\\nand gives them back in the evening is the most chari-\\ntable.” He then asked, ”Who is the ablest man?” The\\nbrahmana answered, ”Everyone is expert in robbing oth-\\ners of their wives and wealth.” The man then asked the\\nbrahmana, ”How do you manage to live in such a city?”\\nThe brahmana replied, ”As a worm survives while even\\nin a ﬁlthy place so do I survive here!”\\n10.

His\\noﬀensive upon the land’s patchwork of small Hindu em-\\npires proved to be highly successful due to the disunity\\nof the petty rulers. It was Chanakya Pandit who, feeling\\ndeeply distressed at heart, searched for and discovered a\\nqualiﬁed leader in the person of Chandragupta Maurya.\\nAlthough a mere dasi-putra, that is, a son of a maidser-\\nvant by the Magadha King Nanda, Chandragupta was\\nhighly intelligent, courageous and physically powerful.\\nChanakya cared little that by birth he should not have\\ndared to approach the throne. A man of acute discre-\\ntion, Chanakya desired only that a ruler of extraordi-\\nnary capabilities be raised to the exalted post of King of', 'dared to approach the throne. A man of acute discre-\\ntion, Chanakya desired only that a ruler of extraordi-\\nnary capabilities be raised to the exalted post of King of\\nMagadha so that the oﬀensive launched by the Yavanas\\n(Greeks) could be repressed.\\nIt is said that Chanakya had been personally of-\\nfended by King Nanda and that this powerful brahmana\\nhad vowed to keep his long sikha unknotted until he\\nsaw to the demise of the contemptuous ruler and his\\ndrunken princes. True to his oath, it was only after\\nChanakya Pandit engineered a swift death for the de-\\ngraded and worthless rulers of the Nanda dynasty that\\nthis great brahmana was able to again tie up his tuft of\\nhair. There are several versions relating the exact way\\nthat Chanakya had set about eliminating the Nandas,\\nand it appears historians have found it diﬃcult to sep-\\narate fact from folk legend as regards to certain speciﬁc\\ndetails.\\nAfter the Nanda downfall, it became easy for Chan-', 'and it appears historians have found it diﬃcult to sep-\\narate fact from folk legend as regards to certain speciﬁc\\ndetails.\\nAfter the Nanda downfall, it became easy for Chan-\\ndragupta to win the support of the Magadha citizens,\\nwho responded warmly to their new heroic and hand-\\nsome young ruler. Kings of neighbouring states rallied\\nunder Chandragupta’s suzerainty and the last of the\\nGreeks headed by Alexander’s general Seleucus were de-\\nfeated.\\nWith the dual obstacles of the Nandas and Alexan-\\nder’s troops out of the way, Chanakya Pandit used every\\npolitical device and intrigue to unite the greater portion\\nof the Indian sub-continent. Under the Prime minis-\\ntership of Chanakya, King Chandragupta Maurya con-\\nquered all the lands up to Iran in the North west and\\ndown to the extremities of Karnataka or Mysore state in\\nthe South. It was by his wits alone that this skinny and\\nill-clad brahmana directed the formation of the great-\\nest Indian empire ever before seen in history (i.e. since', 'the South. It was by his wits alone that this skinny and\\nill-clad brahmana directed the formation of the great-\\nest Indian empire ever before seen in history (i.e. since\\nthe beginning of Kali-yuga). Thus the indigenous Vedic\\nculture of the sacred land of Bharata was protected and\\nthe spiritual practices of the Hindus could go on unham-\\npered.\\nAlthough many great savants of the science of niti\\nsuch as Brihaspati, Shukracharya, Bhartrihari and Vish-\\nnusharma have echoed many of these instructions in\\ntheir own celebrated works, it is perhaps the way that\\nChanakya applied his teachings of niti-shastra that has\\nmade him stand out as a signiﬁcant historical ﬁgure.\\nThe great Pandit teaches us that lofty ideals can become\\na certain reality if we intelligently work towards achiev-\\ning our goal in a determined, progressive and practical\\nmanner.\\nDr. R. Shamashastry, the translator of the English\\nversion of Kautilya’s Artha-Shastra, quotes a predic-', 'ing our goal in a determined, progressive and practical\\nmanner.\\nDr. R. Shamashastry, the translator of the English\\nversion of Kautilya’s Artha-Shastra, quotes a predic-\\ntion from the Vishnu Purana fourth canto, twenty-fourth\\nchapter, regarding the appearance of Chanakya Pandit.\\nThis prediction, incidentally, was scribed ﬁfty centuries\\nago, nearly 2,700 years before this political heavyweight\\nand man of destiny was to appear. The prediction in-\\nforms us: ”(First) Mahapadma then his sons - only nine\\nin number - will be the lords of the earth for a hun-\\ndred years. A brahmana named Kautilya will slay these\\nNandas. On their death, the Mauryas will enjoy the\\nearth. Kautilya himself will install Chandragupta on the\\nthrone. His son will be Bindusara and his son will be\\nAshokavardhana.” Similar prophecies are also repeated\\nin the Bhagavata, Vayu and Matsya Puranas.\\nIn presenting this work I have traced out and re-\\nferred to two old English versions of Chanakya Niti-', 'Ashokavardhana.” Similar prophecies are also repeated\\nin the Bhagavata, Vayu and Matsya Puranas.\\nIn presenting this work I have traced out and re-\\nferred to two old English versions of Chanakya Niti-\\nshastra published at the close of the last century. How-\\never, these apparently were translated by mere schol-\\nars (not devotees) who seem to have missed many sub-\\ntleties of Chanakya’s vast wit and wisdom. Another\\nunedited and unpublished manuscript Chanakya Niti-\\nshastra with both English translation and Latinised translit-\\neration produced by the Vrindavana ISKCON Centre\\nwas also referred to. It was however the learned Vaish-\\nnava pandit and Sanskrit scholar Sri V. Badarayana\\nMurthy, of the South Indian Madhva School, who helped\\nme see the depth and import of these verses from the\\noriginal Devanagari.\\nI have been told that our blessed spiritual master His\\nDivine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada\\nhad expressed a desire that Sri Chanakya Niti-shastra', 'original Devanagari.\\nI have been told that our blessed spiritual master His\\nDivine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada\\nhad expressed a desire that Sri Chanakya Niti-shastra\\nbe properly translated into English. It is hoped that our\\npresent rendering will be at least useful if not instructive\\nto the reader. Let us examine now in a few words on the\\nscience of niti, or common sense, from the pen of Srila\\n1', 'Bhaktivinoda, the great 19th century devotee-pioneer of\\nthe worldwide propagation of Lord Chaitanya ’s divine\\nmessage.\\nTaking the two words ”common sense” right up to\\ntheir highest level, he has written:\\nMan’s glory is in common sense,\\nDictating us the grace,\\nThat man is made to live and love\\nThe beauteous Heaven’s embrace.\\nIn other words, the real goal of niti, indeed the goal\\nof life, is to realise one’s eternal position of Krishna con-\\nsciousness. The Bhagavad-gita conﬁrms Srila Bhaktivin-\\node’s view in the ﬁnal line of its last sloka: dhruva ni-\\ntir matir mama. A translation of that full verse runs:\\n”(Sanjaya said) Wherever there is Krishna the master of\\nall mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna the supreme\\narcher, there will also be opulence, victory, extraordi-\\nnary power and morality (niti). That is My opinion.”\\nMiles Davis (Patita Pavana dasa)\\nMakara Sankranti Day\\nPausa Shukla Navami\\n14th January 1981\\nLucknow, India\\nhttp://www.indiadivine.com/chanakya-niti-shastra.htm', 'Miles Davis (Patita Pavana dasa)\\nMakara Sankranti Day\\nPausa Shukla Navami\\n14th January 1981\\nLucknow, India\\nhttp://www.indiadivine.com/chanakya-niti-shastra.htm\\nChapter One\\n(The Political Ethics of Chanakya Pandit)\\n1.
